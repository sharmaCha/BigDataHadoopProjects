We need to use the HiveQL commands to analyse the stocks data from a ‘New York Stock
Exchange’ dataset and calculate the covariance for a stock.
Dataset:
This dataset is s a comma separated file (CSV) named ‘NYSE_daily_prices_Q.csv’ that contains the
stock information such as daily quotes etc. at New York Stock Exchange.
Covariance: This finance term represents the degree or amount that two stocks or financial
instruments move together or apart from each other. With covariance, investors have the
opportunity to seek out different investment options based upon their respective risk profile. It is a
statistical measure of how one investment moves in relation to another.
- A positive covariance means that asset returns moved together. If investment instruments or
stocks tend to be up or down during the same time periods, they have positive covariance.
- A negative covariance means returns move inversely. If one investment tends to be up while the
other is down, they have negative covariance. 

Use HiveQL to analyse the stock exchange dataset and calculate the covariance between the stocks
for each month. This will help a stock broker in recommending the stocks to his customers.

To solve the given problem, we follow the following steps:
- Start Hive services and ensure that Hive daemons are running in your Hadoop Cluster
- Use HIveQL to create a table with same column names as given in csv file
- Load the csv file in Hive table
- Execute the HiveQL query to get the desired results

1. Problem Solution
#1.1 Create Hive Table
#Use ‘create table’ hive command to create the Hive table for your dataset:
hive> create table nyse (exchange_data String,stock_symbol String,stock_date String,stock_price_open double, stock_price_high double, stock_price_low double, stock_price_close double, stock_volume double, stock_price_adj_close double) row format delimited fields terminated by ",";
#1.2 Load Data to Hive Table
#Use the following Hive command to load data into Hive table:
hive> load data local inpath '/home/cloudera/NYSE_daily_prices_Q.csv' into table nyse;
#1.3 Calculate the Covariance
#Use the following query to calculate the covariance between stocks.
hive> select a.STOCK_SYMBOL, b.STOCK_SYMBOL, month(a.STOCK_DATE),
(AVG(a.STOCK_PRICE_HIGH*b.STOCK_PRICE_HIGH) - (AVG(a.STOCK_PRICE_HIGH)*AVG(b.STOCK_PRICE_HIGH)))
from nyse a join nyse b on
a.STOCK_DATE=b.STOCK_DATE where a.STOCK_SYMBOL<b.STOCK_SYMBOL and year(a.STOCK_DATE)=2008
group by a.STOCK_SYMBOL, b. STOCK_SYMBOL,
month(a.STOCK_DATE);
